#Paradigm Generator

This is an open-source verb paradigm generator. Right now, it's set up for the Spanish language. It uses the Apertium API to generate these paradigms.

If you have thoughts/feedback/issues, leave an issue and I'll get back to you!

This application was created as my final project for Ling 073: Computational Linguistics at Swarthmore College.
